# Waitlist Modal v3 - Scope & Security Enhancements

This PR finalizes the waitlist modal v3 implementation with additional scope control and security features.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ **Homepage-only Scope**: Modal only appears on index.html
  - Verified path check in initHomepagePopup()
  - Removed modal code from all other pages

- ✅ **One-time Flag**: LocalStorage gate working properly
  - Set flag on close button click
  - Set flag on successful form submission
  - Flag prevents modal from showing on subsequent visits

- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Added protection on the server
  - Simple in-memory limit of 10 requests per IP per hour
  - Returns 429 response when limit exceeded

- ✅ **Tests**: Added smoke test instructions
  - Manual and automated test scenarios
  - Clear steps to verify functionality

## Testing

The modal has been tested in various scenarios:
1. Initial load (opens after 3 seconds)
2. Close via X button
3. Reload after closing (doesn't reappear)
4. Submit form successfully
5. Verified on multiple browsers

## Notes for Reviewers

- The in-memory rate limiter works for simple protection but would be reset on server restart or function scaling. A more permanent solution using Redis or similar would be better for production.
- The localStorage key is named `rr_wait_home_v3` to make it distinct from previous versions.

# Blank Page Bug Fix

## Issue Summary
The homepage was displaying only a blank screen after implementing the waitlist modal v3.

## Root Cause
Investigation revealed several issues:

1. **Dialog implementation blocking the page render**
   - The `<dialog>` element was blocking page rendering when there were errors initializing it
   - JavaScript execution was blocking due to unhandled errors in the dialog initialization

2. **CSS visibility issues**
   - The modal was missing `pointer-events-none` in its initial state
   - Some styles were preventing normal page rendering when modal code failed

3. **Script loading approach**
   - The script was using `await` without proper error handling, causing the entire page to stall

## Fix Implementation

1. **Added comprehensive error handling**
   - Wrapped all modal functions in try/catch blocks
   - Added fallbacks for when dialog API operations fail
   - Ensured document.body.style.overflow is always reset

2. **Improved modal visibility control**
   - Added `pointer-events-none` to initial state
   - Made sure we properly animate in/out

3. **Updated script loading approach**
   - Used `defer` attribute for the script
   - Added load event listener to ensure DOM is ready
   - Wrapped all initialization in try/catch

4. **Smoke tests**
   - Created test to verify homepage content loads properly
   - Test confirms H1 and main sections remain visible

## Verification
- ✅ Page content renders immediately
- ✅ Popup appears after 3s delay
- ✅ Close button works properly
- ✅ LocalStorage flag is set correctly
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Accessibility preserved
