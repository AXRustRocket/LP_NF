        "text": "A Meme-Coin Sniper Bot is an automated trading tool designed to detect and execute trades on new meme coin listings or during price pumps with extremely low latency (in our case, as low as 50ms). It allows traders to get in early on promising meme coins before significant price movements occur."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Our 50ms execution speed is achieved through a combination of edge node infrastructure, optimized code written in Rust, and direct connections to Solana validators. When a trading opportunity is detected, our system can execute the transaction in under 50 milliseconds, giving our users a significant advantage over typical traders who experience 500-1000ms latency."
