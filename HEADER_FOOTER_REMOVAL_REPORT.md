# Header and Footer Removal Report

## Summary of Changes

All headers and footers have been successfully removed from the Rust Rocket website. The site now renders content without navigation elements, providing a clean canvas for further development.

## Files Removed

1. **Component Files:**
   - `components/headbar.html` → Archived to `archived/headbar.html`
   - `components/footer.html` → Archived to `archived/footer.html`
   - `components/mobile-nav.html` → Archived to `archived/mobile-nav.html`

2. **JavaScript Files:**
   - `js/headbar.js` → Archived to `archived/headbar.js`

## Files Modified

1. **Include System:**
   - `js/include.js` → Updated to ignore header/footer includes and hide their containers

2. **HTML Pages:**
   - Removed all `<div id="headbarContainer"></div>` elements
   - Removed all `<div id="pageFooter"></div>` elements
   - Removed all `inject('#headbarContainer','/components/headbar')` JavaScript calls
   - Removed all `inject('#pageFooter','/components/footer')` JavaScript calls

3. **Test Files:**
   - `tests/smoke/home-content.spec.ts` → Updated to remove references to header and test for `<main>` content instead

4. **Tailwind Configuration:**
   - `tailwind.config.js` → Removed header/footer-related classes from the safelist:
     - `translate-x-full`, `translate-x-0` (mobile menu animation)
     - `fixed`, `bottom-0`, `h-18` (footer positioning)
     - `bg-spaceDark/80`, `backdrop-blur`, `backdrop-blur-lg` (header styling)

## Status of URLs and Redirects

All page URLs and redirects are still functioning as expected. Legal pages (`/terms`, `/privacy`, `/imprint`, `/aml-policy`) continue to be accessible through their redirects defined in `netlify.toml`.

## Verification

The website was deployed to Netlify and the following checks were performed:

1. **Homepage Load Test:**
   - ✅ URL: [https://rust-rocketx.netlify.app/](https://rust-rocketx.netlify.app/)
   - ✅ Status: 200 OK
   - ✅ Page loads without header/footer elements

2. **Content Verification:**
   - ✅ All main content sections remain visible
   - ✅ No empty spaces where headers/footers were removed
   - ✅ Functionality of user interaction elements preserved

3. **Authentication Flow:**
   - ✅ Waitlist forms and authentication popups continue to function

## Next Steps

1. Any further UI adjustments needed due to the removal of navigation can be addressed in subsequent tasks
2. Main content may need padding/margin adjustments without the header/footer elements
3. Consider adding standalone navigation elements if needed for specific pages
