# Supabase Integration Audit Checklist

## Environment & Configuration Check

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **ENV Variables** | ✅ | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` confirmed for build & client functions. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` restricted to edge/serverless functions only. |
| **Auth Redirects** | ✅ | Confirmed https://rust-rocketx.netlify.app is in Auth Redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard. |
| **Tables/Policies** | ✅ | `waitlist` and `profiles` tables exist with appropriate RLS policies. Anonymous insert is enabled for waitlist. |
| **Edge Functions** | ✅ | `postSignup` function is deployed and active. Inserts profile after successful signup. |
| **Serverless Waitlist** | ✅ | `/api/waitlist` endpoint returns 200 status code and successfully inserts into Supabase. |
| **Frontend Calls** | ✅ | All tested components (waitlist popup, join buttons, magic link login) work without console errors and show appropriate toast messages. |
| **Error Handling** | ✅ | Supabase errors are properly caught and display user-friendly "Try later" messages. Network failure simulation passes. |

## Implementation Details

### 1. Testing Infrastructure

- ✅ **Playwright Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite for waitlist API and authentication flow
- ✅ **CI Integration**: Added workflow in `cli-deploy.yml` that runs E2E tests after build and aborts deploy on failure
- ✅ **Error Simulation**: Tests include proper error handling for invalid inputs and service failures

### 2. Admin & Monitoring

- ✅ **Status Page**: Created `/supabase-status.html` with health checks and table statistics
- ✅ **Access Control**: Status page limited to users with admin role in Supabase user metadata
- ✅ **Monitoring**: Page displays connection info, health status, and edge function verification

### 3. Documentation

- ✅ **Deployment Guide**: Added "Supabase ▶ Netlify Cheat-Sheet" to `DEPLOY_CHECKLIST.md`
- ✅ **Edge Functions Guide**: Documented deployment process for new edge functions
- ✅ **RLS Policies**: Added SQL examples for adding columns with proper RLS policies
- ✅ **API Testing**: Included `curl` examples for testing the waitlist API

## Verification Results

1. **Audit Check**: All items in the audit checklist have been verified and are functioning correctly.
2. **Playwright Tests**: End-to-end tests are passing for all critical user flows.
3. **Status Page**: Admin dashboard correctly shows health status and table information.

## Conclusion

The Supabase integration has been thoroughly audited, tested, and hardened. All components are functioning as expected, and proper documentation has been created for maintenance and future development.

**Recommendation**: The project is ready for migration to the final domain at www.rust-rocket.com.
